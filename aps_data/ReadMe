- 'aps-citations_cleaned.mtx_23_IMPR_circle.json' is the file you need for visualization. It's quite big actually, so it's better to work on smaller trees IN it. See sm.json for an example. You'll figure out how the hierarchy is encoded in json file. "index" attribute of each circle is the id of that subgraph, which will be needed to check its content from *fakedb file -- as explained below.

- 'aps-citation_cleaned.mtx_23_IMPR_fakedb' lists the content of each subgraph. An example line and meaning are as follows:
	200 1 4 5 0.833333 1 490328 505590 525907 531296 -1
	<subgraph_id> <K_number> <#_vertices> <#_edges> <density> <1 for leaf, 0 for parent> <vertex-1> <vertex-2> ... <-1>

- You'll see some vertex size numbers are -19 or so. I just didn't compute the density of anysubgraph with >500 vertices -- and it doesn't matter since we care about <~500 vertex subgraphs. Those -19s do not cause any problem for visualization.

- 'map.txt' is the map from vertex ids to paper DOIs. Each vertex in this data is a paper, and this map file shows that. You can easily get the details by searching that DOI number on web. But I also put the 'aps-dataset-metadata-2013.zip' file that has all that information.

- Please don't hesitate to ask questions. I'm quite busy nowadays, but I'll reply your emails in a few days -- in the worst case.

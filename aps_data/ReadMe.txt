# Internet connection is needed to read d3.js files.
# Run as './vis.sh <json_file>'. It'll create the tmp.html and open it on Safari for the interactive visualization. If no Safari exists, just your your browser to see the html file.
# Example: './vis.sh socfb-Texas84.mtx_23_circle.json' shows all subgraphs	
# Subgraph with the current focus is shown with long dashed lines, and its children subgraphs are with short dashed lines. Labels on children subgraphs are # vertices, edge density (between 0 and 1, 1 for clique), and K number in parenthesis. Densities are also color-coded, blue-red ->0-1.
